i have taken to heart your request that we try to mitigate operational risk .
perhaps i have found another way to serve energy operations .
arthur andersen and risk are sponsoring a conference on operational risk
( www . risk - conferences . com / oprisk 2001 ) . the conference is composed of two
streams , one of which focuses on quantification and mathematical modeling
( neural networks , bayesian models , and other statistical approaches ) . the
quantitative approach to operational risk is akin to how var formalized and
quantified market risk . it is also similar to the curve fitter that i wrote
( which uses mathematics to quantify how " good " or " bad " the back end of a
curve looks given the front end ) .
the conference is next thursday and friday ( 8 - 9 ) in new york ( i just got the
notice today , so i am sorry for the short notice ) .
would you like me to attend ?
regards ,
