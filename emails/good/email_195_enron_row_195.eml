beginning on january 14 th at meter 988022 ( united salt ) , the bav feed into
pops shows excessive flow ( over 200 m / day beginning the 15 th ) . o ' neal brought
this to my attention this evening . this issue will blow out our ua 4 number ,
and probably our p & l . i phoned lee in gas control to make sure a tech was
sent out to check calibration and scada feed . i would like to have better
estimates from the 14 th through the 19 th asap so that we can make corrections
to all pertinent numbers .
thank you ,
