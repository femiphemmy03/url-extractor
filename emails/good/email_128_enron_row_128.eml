vice :
i interviewed nelson last week . here is my feedback :
1 ) very communicative
2 ) good professional experience - works as a consultant
3 ) good quantitative background
he lacks a background in finance , which may be a minus for a position in the
group . i beleive he may be valuable for other areas that deal with emissions
and pollutants .
