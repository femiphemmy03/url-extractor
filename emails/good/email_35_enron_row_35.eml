with respect to my assignments jp morgan and dominion -
there is apparently some confusion regarding whether a master netting agreement should be prepared for the j . p . morgan group or for the morgan stanley group . we have been unable to obtain confirmation regarding the correct entities .
for dominion , i await the master physical agreements from canada and the credit information from credit . other agreements have been reviewed and the form of master netting agreement marked up with the information available .
