# url-extractor
This project implements a command-line `URLExtractor` tool that parses `.eml` email files, extracts HTML or text content, and identifies unique HTTP/HTTPS URLs. It processes a single `.eml` file via command-line argument and supports batch processing of 500 emails (250 genuine, 250 spam) with parallel processing and JSON output.
